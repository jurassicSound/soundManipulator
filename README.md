# soundManipulator
Basic C++ sound changing program that uses the xAudio2 API. The idea of this program is to provide a basic way to manipulate sounds in the same way sound designers for movies do. The program can also support up to 7.1 surround sound. The only kind of audio file that can be used with this program right now is .wav files.
